	         <p>We realised the computer games industry is very profitable for successful developers. Did you know computergames actually makes more money than the film industry and music industry combined? We are trying to shake things up and have produced a different kind of business model for platforming gaming that gives money back to the users. We will offer half our profit as a prize pot each week for the players who win the most points. If we make no money we cant offer any prize fund, but as we grow, the people who win will be our users.

	         <hr />

	         <p>Our team of two is based in London, England where we have been working day and night to get things off the ground (insert drone joke here), but the work has been slow and steady. This platform is a work in progress during our Beta mode while we run testing, experimenting, failing and debugging. Thanks for your patience.

      		<h3>Our Process.</h3>

	      	<p>We hope to revolutionise the gaming industry. I don't know about you but I have played too many games on tablets and mobile devices that start asking you for money to unlock the gems or whatever crap you need to progress. It's really frustrating and we are hoping to change this. Instead of asking you for money, we aim to be giving away, to our users, as a reward for playing well. Crazy idea right?
	         </p>

      	</div> <!-- /left -->

      	<div class="mob-whole six columns right">

	      	<h3>Our Approach.</h3>

	      	<p>If we can make a successful platfrom, it should make some money through advertising, that we can then give to you. We will literally split half the profit with our users. The money to pay and maintain the platform comes first, and then 50% goes to our staff and 50% to you lucky users.

	      	<h3>Our Goal.</h3>

	      	<p>Making a fun computer game thats free to play, which pays the top players is a new concept. Earning the most points and winning money seems like i wonderful idea to us. We will also pay people who want to connet their own robots depending on how popular those bots become. The more popular the bots, the more money they will make the owner.

			   <p>If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten. So we are trying to do something new, while building it up from the bottom. We are going out on a limb here, because that’s where all the fruit grows. This is a work in progress, with a blog of the work arose.

	               <p>The proof is in the pudding. We won't know whether the system works until we try it. Dave has coded in a working LED that can be switched on over a local network but can we get it working so it can be controlled over the web. We have such a long way to go.

	               Drew P is struggling without the brian power of Dave W. I wrote a poem for the LED's.
                       "Roses are red. Violets are blue. If i had a brick, I’d throw it at you!"
