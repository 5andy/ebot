## Synopsis

We are building an open source gaming platfrom website for people to control and play with robots to over the internet.


## Motivation

We realised the computer games industry is very profitable for successful developers. Did you know computergames actually makes more money than the film industry and music industry combined? We are trying to shake things up and have produced a different kind of business model for platforming gaming that gives money back to the users. We will offer half our profit as a prize pot each week for the players who win the most points. If we make no money we cant offer any prize fund, but as we grow, the people who win will be our users.
